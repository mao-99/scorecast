## **Series Overview**

1. **Introduction to the Soccer Modeling Application**
   - Objective: Understand the project's scope and end goal.
   - Tools/Technologies: Python, Pandas, Selenium, React, Express.js, Databases, UML diagrams.

2. **Data Sourcing by Scraping Data**
   - Learn to scrape data from Flashscore.com using Selenium and Python.
   - Save raw data in formats like JSON or CSV.

3. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - Use Python and Pandas to clean and structure raw data.
   - Prepare the data for database population and analysis.

4. **Designing the Data Structure**
   - Create a UML diagram to map out the general structure and schema of the data.
   - Plan how cleaned data will fit into the database structure.

5. **Database Design and Population**
   - Design and implement an ERD for the database.
   - Populate the database with cleaned and structured data.

6. **Building the API and Backend Server**
   - Use Express.js to build a backend server.
   - Create API endpoints for accessing soccer statistics.
   - Perform basic CRUD operations.

7. **Frontend Development**
   - Build the user interface using React.
   - Connect the frontend to the backend API.
   - Dynamically display soccer data.

8. **Final Wrap-Up**
   - Showcase the complete application.
   - Share tips for future enhancements.
   - Encourage viewers to explore and experiment further.
